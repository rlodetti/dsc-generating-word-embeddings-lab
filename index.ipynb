    "# Generating Word Embeddings - Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll learn how to generate word embeddings by training a Word2Vec model, and then embedding layers into deep neural networks for NLP!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Train a Word2Vec model and transform words into vectors \n",
    "- Obtain most similar words by using methods associated with word vectors \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll start by creating your own word embeddings by making use of the Word2Vec model. Then, you'll move onto building neural networks that make use of **_Embedding Layers_** to accomplish the same end-goal, but directly in your model. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you've seen, the easiest way to make use of Word2Vec is to import it from the [Gensim Library](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/). This model contains a full implementation of Word2Vec, which you can use to begin training immediately. For this lab, you'll be working with the [News Category Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-category-dataset/version/2#_=_).  This dataset contains headlines and article descriptions from the news, as well as categories for which type of article they belong to.\n",

Remember that for a Word2Vec model you can specify a  **_Window Size_** that tells the model how many words to take into consideration at one time. \n",
    "\n",
    "If your window size was 5, then the model would start by looking at the words \"Will Smith joins Diplo and\", and then slide the window by one, so that it's looking at \"Smith joins Diplo and Nicky\", and so on, until it had completely processed the text example at index 1 above. By doing this for every piece of text in the entire dataset, the Word2Vec model learns excellent vector representations for each word in an **_Embedding Space_**, where the relationships between vectors capture semantic meaning (recall the vector that captures gender in the previous \"king - man + woman = queen\" example you saw).\n",
